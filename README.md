# theHangedManWpf

***Simple game where you try to guess the word and not hang the man.***

Simple demonstration of my work in C#. After turning on the game, you have 11 lives to guess the word that was randomly generated for you. If you succeed, you can add yourself to the list of players, if you don't guess, hang the guy and you can repeat the game.
